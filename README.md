# DataMerging-Classification
Binary classification problem, for which both a dataset is provided. The dataset is split into two tables, which should be combined first. 
The “id” column is present in both tables and should be used for matching. The “class” column is the target variable.

Four main points:
1. Data preprocessing
  > - Missing data
  > - Noisy data
2. Data transformation
  > - Atribute selection
3. Model selection
  > - Logistic regression
  > - Random forest
  > - Linear support vector machine
4. Models evaluation
  > - Confusion matrix
  > - Accuracy
5. Plotting
